# Digit-Recognition-
Trying algorithms to classify handwritten digits correctly.


Here we use the MNIST data set available in sklearn.datasets. Attempt to classify 5/not-5 is made using binary classifiers.



#Stochastic Gradient Classifier
Confusion matrix, ROC curves, PR curves used.

Multiclass classification is done using OvA approach.
Feautures Scaled.


Noise is added and model is trained to clean it.
